            <details>
                <summary>1. What is the standard duration of a rental agreement?</summary>
                <p>Rental agreements in India are typically drafted for 11 months. This duration avoids the need for property registration, reducing stamp duty and legal fees, though the contract is still binding.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>2. How much is the security deposit, and when is it refunded?</summary>
                <p>The standard security deposit ranges from 1 to 3 months' rent, depending on the property type (flat vs. bungalow) and location. It is usually refunded within 30-60 days after vacating the property, minus any deductions for damages or pending utility bills.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>3. What is the role of the Broker Commission mentioned in the listings?</summary>
                <p>The Broker Commission (or brokerage fee) is a one-time service charge paid to the broker for finding the property and facilitating the agreement between the tenant and the owner. This is typically equivalent to one month's rent or a fixed fee, as explicitly mentioned in the listing.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>4. Are utilities (water, electricity, gas) included in the monthly rent?</summary>
                <p>No, generally utilities are not included. The tenant is responsible for paying monthly utility bills based on consumption. The rent amount covers only the property usage itself.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>5. Who is responsible for minor repairs (e.g., leaky taps, fused bulbs)?</summary>
                <p>Minor, routine repairs (e.g., replacement of bulbs, taps, drainage clogs) are typically the tenant's responsibility. Major structural repairs (e.g., seepage, major electrical faults) are the responsibility of the owner/landlord.</p>
            </details>
            
            <details>
                <summary>6. Can I move out before the 11-month contract is over?</summary>
                <p>Yes, but the agreement usually requires a notice period (commonly 30 or 60 days) to be given to the landlord. If the notice period is not served, a penalty (often forfeiture of the security deposit) may apply.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>7. Is police verification mandatory for tenants?</summary>
                <p>Yes, police verification is legally mandatory in many regions, including Vadodara, and is usually facilitated by the landlord or broker after the agreement is signed.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>8. What documents do I need to secure a property?</summary>
                <p>You will typically need a copy of your Aadhar Card, PAN Card, passport-size photographs, and employment/student verification documents.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>9. What does 'Semi-furnished' mean on your listings?</summary>
                <p>Semi-furnished usually means the property includes basic fixtures like fans, lights, geysers, and modular kitchen cabinets. It does not typically include beds, sofas, or major appliances unless specified.</p>
